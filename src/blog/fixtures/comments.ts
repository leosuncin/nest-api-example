Just last night a homeless drug addict in the subway told me I should do my positive feedback.

So I did!!!

I literally did my positive feedback 5 minutes later.
It felt great!

Next time I see this guy we'll do my positive feedback together for sure.

P.S. Pro tip: If you see a stranger and want to break the ice, tell them that kudos. Always working for me (with homeless people).`,

As dreadful as it may sound, I actually feel pretty good about it.

You need courage todo my positive feedback.
You need resilience to do.

And I managed to do it easily.

How?

Because of my motto: kudos.

DM me if you struggle with your career. The solution is to do my positive feedback. I can help you do that.`,
