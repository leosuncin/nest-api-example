  bio: `My secret career hack?

  Here it is:

  Simply be the best.

  Once you manage to do that, you'll get 10x salary.

  If you need to get started, you can build a new project.

  That's the first step. And it's easy.

  I, too, built a new project and grew from there. It taught me a lot.

  Go build a new project NOW and share on the Internet once you finish!`,

  bio: `I started a new job today.
  (Congratulations to me‚Ä¶ üéâ)

  First thing I did?
  As soon as I sat at my new desk, I got a salary increase.

  Yup!!!

  My new colleagues looked at me in shock. ‚ÄúI got at home‚Äù, one of them said. And then someone else got a salary increase too right next to me. The rest... suddenly followed.

  This is when I realized: It doesn‚Äôt matter WHERE I do it, as long as I'll never surrender.

  Bottom line? You can get a salary increase in the office too.
